BusTub is a relational database management system built at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://db.cs.cmu.edu) for the [Introduction to Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu) (15-445/645) course. This system was developed for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments.

## Build

### Linux / Mac
To ensure that you have the proper packages on your machine, run the following script to automatically install them:

```
$ sudo build_support/packages.sh
```

Then run the following commands to build the system:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

If you want to compile the system in debug mode, pass in the following flag to cmake:
Debug mode:

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$ make
```
This enables [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers), which can generate false positives for overflow on STL containers. If you encounter this, define the environment variable `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_container_overflow=0`.

### Windows
If you are using Windows 10, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to develop, build, and test Bustub. All you need is to [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). You can just choose "Ubuntu" (no specific version) in Microsoft Store. Then, enter WSL and follow the above instructions.

If you are using CLion, it also [works with WSL](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2018/01/clion-and-linux-toolchain-on-windows-are-now-friends).

## Testing
```
$ cd build
$ make check-tests
```

## Build environment

If you have trouble getting cmake or make to run, an easy solution is to create a virtual container to build in. There are two options available:

### Vagrant
First, make sure you have Vagrant and Virtualbox installed
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install vagrant virtualbox
```

From the repository directory, run this command to create and start a Vagrant box:

```
$ vagrant up
```

This will start a Vagrant box running Ubuntu 20.02 in the background with all the packages needed. To access it, type

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

to open a shell within the box. You can find Bustub's code mounted at `/bustub` and run the commands mentioned above like normal.

### Docker
First, make sure that you have docker installed:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install docker
```

From the repository directory, run these commands to create a Docker image and container:

```
$ docker build . -t bustub
$ docker create -t -i --name bustub -v $(pwd):/bustub bustub bash
```

This will create a Docker image and container. To run it, type:

```
$ docker start -a -i bustub
```

to open a shell within the box. You can find Bustub's code mounted at `/bustub` and run the commands mentioned above like normal.
